# SankeyMATIC (Local Copy)


Originally produced by **Steve Bogart** ([@nowthis@tilde.zone](https://tilde.zone/@nowthis)) of **http://sankeymatic.com/build/**. Which in turn was initially built on a [fork of that very d3 Sankey library](https://github.com/nowthis/d3-plugin-captain-sankey) and evolving from there, SankeyMATIC is intended to make it possible for anyone with a web browser to generate complex and beautiful flow diagrams while requiring zero knowledge of coding.


SankeyMATIC originally

* Describe your data using text.
* Customize your diagram's appearance interactively.
* Export a finished product as a PNG image and as SVG code.
* Export/import your work in progress as readable (and diff-able) plain text files.

### Packages used:

* [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) version 7.x
* [Canvg](https://github.com/canvg/canvg) 3.0.9

### Background:

SankeyMATIC was inspired by the big energy flow diagram in [d3](http://d3js.org/)'s gallery of examples (visible these days [at ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey)).

This version of sankey diagram was tweaked and trimmed to only the purposes of financials and a simplified framework.
